# NASA APi Website project

##Summary

This project is designed to fetch images from the astronomical picture of the day and also NASA's asteroid api to view them and collect them to a gallery using IndexedDb to view at a later date. I wanted to do this as the original NASA's APOD (link) website is very limited with very little features apart from viewing the daily pictures so I created one with features such as saving the information you like into a collection/gallery to add more interactivity and to be able to go back on the picture you are interested in without trying to remeber the date of of the image.

###Daily Images Page

####how it works

###Asteroid Page

####What it does
This page displays a collection of asteroids that will pass by the earth today and show previous days as you scroll down using fetch and intersection observers. There is also a save button which will save asteroids information (speed, size, time of closest approach) to your asteroid collection in the gallery.



###Gallery/collection


####what it does
This page gets all key value pairs in each of the indexedDB objectStores and displays the information in a responsive format on the screen. This page also has a nav tab to divide formats. For example...
